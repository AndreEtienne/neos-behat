Abstract
========

This package contains some useful add-ons and bugfixes/workarounds for using Behat-Tests in Neos projects.

## Installation and Setup

### Install

This package is currently not available via Packagist, configure the repo in `composer.json`:

```
	"repositories": [
		{
			"type": "git",
			"url": "git@github.com:cron-eu/neos-behat.git"
		}
	]
```

Then use composer to install this package:

```
composer require cron/neos-behat:dev-master
```

### Setup

Create the file `Tests/Behavior/Features/Bootstram/FeatureContext.php` with this content:

```
<?php

require_once(__DIR__ . '/../../../../../../Application/CRON.Behat/Tests/Behat/FeatureContextBase.php');

class FeatureContext extends \CRON\Behat\FeatureContextBase {

}
```

#### Example Scenario

This scenario imports the site package and ensure that the Root-Page is reachable without throwing any exceptions.

File: `Tests/Behavior/Features/Example.feature`

```
@browser
Feature: Basic Features

  Background: Import Demo-Content
    Given I imported the site "MY.Package"

  @fixtures @remote
  Scenario: Call the Root-Page of the Site Package
    Given I go to "/"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And I should not see "Exception"
```

### Run the Example.feature

```
bin/behat -c Packages/Sites/My.Site/Tests/Behavior/behat.yml Packages/Sites/My.Site/Tests/Behavior/Features/Example.feature
```

## Behat and Unit/Functional Tests with million12 Docker Setup

### Install required dev dependencies

#### Install the dev packages (once)

```
composer update
cd Build/Behat && composer install
make docker-sync
```

#### Install the dev packages inside the dev-machine and restart (once):

SSH to the dev container and do the same there

```
compose update
cd Build/Behat && composer install
```

```
cd ~/Developer/Docker/dav-daz
git pull
```

Make sure that the ENV VAR `T3APP_DO_INIT_TESTS` is set to true in docker-compose.yml and then restart the web container:

```
docker-compose stop
docker-compose up -d
```

This will also re-create the Behat-Settings (Behat-Contexts and behat.yml in `*/Tests/Behavior/*`)

Make sure that `./flow help` is running ok (else, delete `Configuration/PackageStates.php` and try again)

Wait for the web container to be fully functional (`php-fpm entered RUNNING state` message in `docker-compose logs web`)

### Run Tests

Tests are executed using the [million12/php-testing:php56 Container](https://github.com/million12/docker-php-testing).
A Wrapper Shell-Script is provided for convenience (note: in the `docker` branch!)

```
cd ~/Developer/Docker/dav-daz
./tests/behat.sh
```

The Wrapper Script will also pass all shell arguments to the behat command, e.g. this will work:

(cwd is $SITE_ROOT/Tests/Behavior Directory)

```
./tests/behat.sh Features/EmptySite.feature
```

### Common Issues

#### behat: No such file or directory

Make sure to have `T3APP_DO_INIT_TESTS` ENV var set to true in your `docker-compose.yml` and to restart the containers
(see above). Else, inspect the logs from `docker-compose logs web` and check for error messages while initializing the
Behat Settings.
